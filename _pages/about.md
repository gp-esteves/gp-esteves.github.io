<br/><br/>
🍎 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Nutrition and Metabolism from the University of São Paulo (USP). 

🎓 I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate USP, and member of the Applied Physiology & Nutrition Research Group, as part of the Center of Lifestyle Medicine.

🔬 My research explores the role of nutrition and physical exercise interventions in improving the health and quality of life in clinical populations. I'm also interested in sports science and the use of ergogenic supplements for sports performance. 

🖥️ I also have a keen interest in statistics, data science and analysis, and aim to produce openly acessible and reproducible statistical code using R.

### [Protein and Amino Acid Adequacy and Food Consumption by Processing Level in Vegans in Brazil](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820203)

My role in this paper: data management, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I was also part of the design of the original survey, elaborating research question and objetives, as well as manuscript writing and publication.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this study, most individuals who adhered to a vegan diet attained protein and essential amino acid intake recommendations, largely based their diet of unprocessed and minimally processed food, and had a significantly lower proportion of ultraprocessed food intake compared with previous reports. Participants consuming less ultraprocessed food were more likely to have inadequate protein intake, suggesting a significant reliance on ultraprocessed proteins for this population.
