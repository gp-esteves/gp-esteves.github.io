🍎 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Nutrition and Metabolism from the University of São Paulo (USP). 

🎓 I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate USP, and member of the Applied Physiology & Nutrition Research Group, as part of the Center of Lifestyle Medicine.

🔬 My research explores the role of nutrition and physical exercise interventions in improving the health and quality of life in clinical populations. I'm also interested in sports science and the use of ergogenic supplements for sports performance. 

🖥️ I also have a keen interest in statistics, data science and analysis, and aim to produce openly acessible and reproducible statistical code using R.
